## Spread Syntax
- Expect 0+ arguments, expandable

- Usage:
-- Inserting array into array
```
var mid = [3, 4];
var arr = [1, 2, ...mid, 5, 6]
``` 
-- Math operations on array elements
```
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 5];
var max = Math.max(...arr);
```
-- Copying array
```
var arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
var arr2 = [...arr];
```
This actually makes a copy of arr into arr2, and is not the same as assigning reference to arr as we would use it in `arr2 = arr`.

-- String to Array
```
var str = "hello";
var chars = [...str];
```
This is equivalent to `str.split("")`
