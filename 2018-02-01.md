## Caching Photos
- Caching photos in IndexDB along with other text stuff isn't ideal, as we are reading the pixel data and converting it to a blob. It also loses streaming == performance impact.

- Caching photos from Cache API is a better fit, as we're streaming the data == memory efficient, faster render

- Since we want photos to live between versions of the app, we cache it in a separate cache, different from where other static stuff are stored.

- **You can only use the body of a response once.**

```
event.respondWith(
	caches.open('<img-cache>').then(function(cache) {
		return fetch(request).then(function(response) {
			cache.put(request, response.clone());
			return response;
		})
	})
)
```
**We need to clone the response**
