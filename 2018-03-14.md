## Issues & Resolutions when running `react-native run-android`
- When building the project that you've downloaded the first time, you may run into issues with an error message like this:

```java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/android/build/gradle/AppPlugin : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0```

Resolution:
1. Navigate to your project folder under `<project>/android/app/` and locate a file called `build.gradle`.
2. Find the line of code that says: `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.3'`.
3. Modify the line of code to: `com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.0`.


```SDK location not found. Define location with sdk.dir in the local.properties file or with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable.```

Resolution:
1. Navigate to your project folder under `<project>/android/` and create a file called `local.properties`.
2. Within the new file created, type in the following and save:
```
(Mac) sdk.dir = /Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Android/sdk
(Windows) sdk.dir = C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Android/sdk
(Linux) sdk.dir = /home/USERNAME/Android/Sdk
```
