What's new in ES6, ES2015, or Harmony (Whatever you want to call it?!)

## let and const
JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, before executing the code, all variables (`var`) are "hoisted", meaning they are raised to the top of the function scope. 

In ES6, new variable declaration (`let` and `const`) eliminates this specific hoisting issue because they are scoped to the block (denoted by curly braces `{ }`).

- `let`: Can be reassigned, can't be redeclared within the scope.
- `const`: Has to be assigned an initial value. Cannot be reassigned, and cannot be redeclared within the scope.

### Use cases for `let` and `const`
- Use `let` when you plan to reassign new values to a variable.
- Use `const` when you don't plan on reassigning new values to a variable.

- What about `var`?
-- Globally define variables, but generally bad practice and should be avoided!


## Template Literals
Prior to ES6, to concatenate strings together can only be done using the concatenation operator (`+`) or the String `concat()` method. Template literals are introduced to include embedded expressions. 

- Denoted by backticks instead of single quotes or double quotes.
- Supports placeholders such as `${expression}`.
- Newline characters (`\n`) can be dropped.

## Destructuring
In ES6, you can extract data from arrays and objects into distinct variables using destructuring.

- Pre-ES6 (Extracting from array):
```
const point = [10, 25, -34];

const x = point[0];
const y = point[1];
const z = point[2];

console.log(x, y, z);
```
-- Destructuring in ES6:
```
const point = [10, 25, -34];

const [x, y, z] = point;

console.log(x, y, z);
```
The bracket `[]` represented the array being destructured and `x, y, z` represent the variables that you want to store the values in. No indexes are needed. Indexes can also be ignored in destructuring, 

- Pre-ES6 (Extracting from object):
```
const gemstone = {
  type: 'quartz',
  color: 'rose',
  karat: 21.29
};

const type = gemstone.type;
const color = gemstone.color;
const karat = gemstone.karat;

console.log(type, color, karat);
```
-- Destructuring in ES6:
```
const gemstone = {
  type: 'quartz',
  color: 'rose',
  karat: 21.29
};

const {type, color, karat} = gemstone;

console.log(type, color, karat);
```

## Object Literal Shorthand
- Object variables
```
let type = 'quartz';
let color = 'rose';
let carat = 21.29;

const gemstone = {
  type: type,
  color: color,
  carat: carat
};
```
becomes
```
const gemstone = {type, color, carat};
```

- Functions
`xxx: function(){}` becomes `xxx(){}`

## Iteration
- Iterable protocol
	Allows JS objects to define or customize iteration behavior
- For...of loop
	A loop that iterates over iterable objects

Before ES6, the biggest downside of a loop is to keep track of the counter and exit condition. 

Improvements with a "for...in" loop:
```
const digits = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
for (const index in digits) {
  console.log(digits[index]);
}
```
This is still confusing because it uses an index to access values of the array.

`forEach()` is an alternative array method you can use, but is exclusive to arrays and has no way to stop or break a forEach loop.

### The Power of a for...of loop
```
const digits = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
for (const digit of digits) {
  console.log(digit);
}
```

```
const days = ['sunday', 'monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday', 'saturday'];
for (const day of days) {
    console.log(day[0].toUpperCase() + day.slice(1));
}
```

## Spread Operator (`...`)
- Combining arrays with concat, previously forced to use Array's `concat()` method:
```
const fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "pears"];
const vegetables = ["corn", "potatoes", "carrots"];
const produce = fruits.concat(vegetables);
```
becomes this simple in ES6:
`const produce = [...fruits, ...vegetables];`

## Rest Parameter (`...` again!)
```
const order = [20.17, 18.67, 1.50, "cheese", "eggs", "milk", "bread"];
const [total, subtotal, tax, ...items] = order;
```
Here, `items` is `["cheese", "eggs", "milk", "bread"]`
- Represents an indefinite number of elements as an array
- Considered the opposite of spread operator

### Variadic Functions
Functions that take in indefinite number of arguments
- Before ES6, `sum()` looks to be misleading as it seems to not take in any arguments, but in fact it takes indefinite number of args. 
- ES6 using rest parameters, `sum(...nums)` looks more straightforward.
