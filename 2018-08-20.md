## Gulp
`Gulp` is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, especially for front-end web development.

* (Optional) Install `gulp` globally by running:
```
npm install -g gulp
```
* Install `gulp` locally on your project folder by running:
```
npm install gulp
```
OR (Optional) link your globally installed `gulp` by running:
```
npm link gulp
```
The reason being that gulp tries to run your `gulpfile.js` using your locally installed gulp.
* Install `gulp-sass` by running:
```
npm install gulp-sass`
```

### To run gulp
Execute a specific task by writing specific automated functions in the `gulpfile.js`, where a sample `gulpfile` task looks like this:
```javascript
// 'styles' is the task name that we'll parse in when executing
gulp.task('styles', function() {
// Sources the scss files from the sass folder
	gulp.src('sass/**/*.scss')
		// Listen to the error, and logs it to the terminal
		.pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))
    // Adds in the prefix for different browsers
		.pipe(autoprefixer({
			browsers: ['last 2 versions']
		}))
		// Save the gulp results into the css folder
		.pipe(gulp.dest('./css'));
});
```
We would then execute this task by running:
```
gulp styles
```

This will create any corresponding css files in the `./css` folder with the task we specified.
